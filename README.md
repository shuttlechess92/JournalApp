Journal


This is an application I created that allows one to keep a simple journal of their daily thoughts.
The format for entering the dates of entries is: 2013 September 20  (capitalize month).
The journal has functionalities to save entries, add to entries (this is done by writing to entry of the 
date in question), and to scroll through entries by day, week, and month.
Picture functionality is working but not yet completed.
